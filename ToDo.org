* TODO add the option to get isotopes from snapshots
  reading abundances from flowfiles takes longer since you need to check whether the isotope is already in the list
  also some isotopes are abundant but have no flow going in and out and are thus not plotte
* TODO add function to write out flowfiles to save integrated flows
* TODO add elementlabel to plots
* TODO add colorbars outside of plot
* TODO add tick locators
* TODO adjust zorder
